## Recommender System - Association Rule Learning

###  Problem Statement
We have a dataset which has the data of 7000 rows, where each row shows the products purchased by a customer at the Big Mart. We have to determine which are the products that are being bought together. The results would be used according to the strategy of the Big Mart. ( Either they could place the items nearer to each other or far away from each other )

### What will we do ?
Using the data from the dataset, we will build a recommender system where we will result in the output file which consists of the new rules.

### What are the Algorithms being used here?
1. Apriori
2. Eclat

> Apriori is recommended for better results, while Eclat for faster results
> 
> Here the output file consists of the results from the Eclat algorithm. For results from the Apriori Algorithm, execute the apriori python program.
